# Car Price Versus Engine Price and Horsepower Analysis

An analysis was conducted to determine if car resale price is influenced by engine size (in cc's) and horsepower. 
The project uses data derived from Kaggle. Overall, findings demontrate consumers that purchase less expensive cars are generally more concerned
with horsepower, rather than engine size. Additionally, customers in the premium car market are less concerned with horsepowerâ€”and are likely more concerned with
features and design.
