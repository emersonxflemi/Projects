# Car_Resale_README

The following project analyzes a used car dataset from Kaggle to assess why American cars sell for less than Japanese and German counterparts. 
Findings indicate this phenomenon occurs due to failure for American vehicles to exist in ideal thresholds for price and horsepower. Findings illustrate
most customers purchase less expensive vehicles with less horsepower, or more premium vehicles with more horsepower; American 
vehicles exist in the center of this spectrum. Therefore, according to the analysis, American brands fail to hold value due to an inability to create vehicles inside the ideal "price to horsepower range" for customers.
