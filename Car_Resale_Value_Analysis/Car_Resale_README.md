# Car Resale Readme

The following project analyzes a used car dataset from Kaggle to assess why American cars sell for less than their Japanese and German counterparts. 
Findings indicate this phenomenon occurs due to failure for American vehicles to exist in ideal thresholds for price and horsepower. In other words,
customers are generally in the market for more inexpensive vehicles with less horsepower or more premium vehicles with more horsepower. American 
vehicles tend to be in the middle of this spectrum with regards to price and horsepower. Therefore, one major reason American brands fail to hold value like
as competitors occurs due to an inability to create vehicles inside the ideal "price to horsepower range" for customers.
